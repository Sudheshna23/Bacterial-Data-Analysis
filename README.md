# Bacterial-Data-Analysis
This project tries to analyse the bacterial data obtained from Kaggle (https://share.google/KeEEMX7leRg1FP395), and tries to clean, and process it.
A list of questions have been answered after performing data analysis using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries, so as to gain insights from the data.
