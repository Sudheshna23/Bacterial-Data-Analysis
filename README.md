# Bacterial-Data-Analysis
This project tries to analyse the bacterial data obtained from Kaggle (https://share.google/KeEEMX7leRg1FP395), and tries to clean, and process it.
A list of questions have been answered after performing data analysis using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries, so as to gain insights from the data.

# Analytical Inquiries
1. Top families of Bacteria
2. Nature of Bacteria (Harmful vs Not Harmful)
3. Top 10 locations where the bacteria a are found
4. Relationship between bacterial families and their nature
5. Relationship between bacterial location and their nature

# Conclusions drawn from the data
1. Enteriobacteriaceae, Bacillaceae and Streptococcaceae were found to be the top 3 families of bacterial species.
2. Out of the 200 bacterial species analysed 51.3% were found to be not harmful whereas 48.7% were found to be harmful.
3. Soil, Water and Instestinal tract were found to be the top 3 locations where bacterial species could be found.
